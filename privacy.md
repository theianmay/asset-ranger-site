# AssetRanger Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: August 14, 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to AssetRanger ("we," "our," or "us"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Camera Access
AssetRanger requests access to your device's camera solely for the purpose of scanning barcodes of assets for quick data entry. We do not capture, store, or transmit any images or video content from your camera to external servers.

### Location Information
When you opt-in, we collect location data to tag where an asset was scanned, improving asset tracking accuracy. This information is stored locally on your device. We do not track your location when the app is not in use.

### User-Provided Information
We collect information you voluntarily provide when using our app, such as:
- Asset details (names, descriptions, categories, barcodes)
- User preferences and settings
- Default values for forms
- Digital signatures for approval workflows
- Import/export data (CSV, JSON files)

### Notification Permissions
When you opt-in, we request notification permissions to send reminders about overdue items. These notifications are generated locally on your device and do not involve external servers.

### Storage Access
We request storage permissions to enable import and export of data files (CSV, JSON, PDF). This allows you to backup your data and share approval documents.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Enable core functionality (asset tracking, barcode scanning, check-in/check-out workflows)
- Generate approval documents and reports
- Provide overdue item notifications
- Enable data import/export for backup and sharing
- Maintain audit trails for compliance
- Improve app performance and user experience

## Data Storage and Security

All data is stored locally on your device using SQLite database with appropriate security measures. We do not transmit your data to external servers. The app operates offline-first, ensuring your data remains under your control.

## Third-Party Services

AssetRanger does not share your data with third-party services. We do not sell your data to advertisers or other third parties.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Access all data stored locally on your device
- Edit or delete any asset information
- Export your complete data set via CSV or JSON
- Withdraw consent for location tracking at any time
- Disable notifications in app settings
- Uninstall the app to remove all local data

## Children's Privacy

Our app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected information from your child, please contact us.
